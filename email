Slide 1: Objectives
The primary goal of the analysis is to reduce overall call volumes and enhance customer experience by addressing repeat call issues. This includes:

Lowering operational costs by minimizing repeated interactions.
Improving member satisfaction by resolving recurring issues promptly.
Streamlining call center operations for better efficiency.
Increasing the adoption of self-service tools by addressing gaps in digital solutions.
Our analysis is tailored to meet these goals, with a focus on identifying actionable areas to improve efficiency and member satisfaction.

Slide 2: Frequency Distribution of Repeat Calls Based on Window Size
This slide explores the relationship between the timeframe for considering repeat calls and the number of calls flagged as repeats. The data shows diminishing returns beyond a 30-day window.

Our Findings: A 30-day window captures most meaningful repeat calls while minimizing unnecessary flags. This threshold balances accuracy with operational efficiency.
Slide 3: Year-over-Year Trend Analysis
There has been a steady increase in repeat calls over the past three years, from 21% in 2022 to 28% in 2024. This could indicate gaps in first-call resolution or rising customer concerns.

Our Findings: Our year-over-year analysis reflects the same growth trend, signaling the importance of addressing systemic issues causing repeated inquiries.
Slide 4: Quarter-over-Quarter Trend Analysis
The analysis identifies recurring seasonal peaks, especially in Q2 and Q4, suggesting external factors or operational challenges might be influencing repeat calls during these periods.

Our Findings: Quarterly patterns in our data align, reinforcing the need to investigate and address specific issues contributing to these fluctuations.
Slide 5: Month-over-Month Trend Analysis
Monthly data shows distinct spikes in February and April, likely linked to seasonal or operational challenges.

Our Findings: Our analysis confirms these spikes, highlighting the need to focus on root causes during these months to mitigate their impact.
Slide 6: Seasonality Identification
Higher repeat call volumes are observed on Thursdays and Fridays, which could be attributed to member behavior or workload dynamics.

Our Findings: These patterns align with our data, emphasizing the need for better resource allocation and strategies to handle the increased volume on these days.
Slide 7: Developing KPIs
The slide outlines KPIs such as Repeat Call Rate, Average Handle Time (AHT), and Cost per Repeat Call. These metrics provide a framework to measure and address repeat call performance.

Our Findings: We have calculated these KPIs using our data, providing actionable insights to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs.
Slide 8: Pivot Analysis
The analysis identifies key drivers of repeat calls, such as "Eligibility" and "Billing," which contribute significantly to total call volumes.

Our Findings: Our data supports these categories as primary contributors to repeat calls, indicating that targeted improvements in these areas can have a substantial impact.
Slide 9: Driver Analysis
Using a decision tree approach, the analysis highlights specific patterns, such as members aged 60â€“65 and evening calls, which are more likely to result in repeat inquiries.

Our Findings: Our driver analysis validates these patterns, providing a clear direction for targeted interventions to reduce repeat calls effectively.
